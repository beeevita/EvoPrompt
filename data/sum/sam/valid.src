A: Hi Tom, are you busy tomorrow’s afternoon? B: I’m pretty sure I am. What’s up? A: Can you go with me to the animal shelter?. B: What do you want to do? A: I want to get a puppy for my son.

A: Oh, yes, I took him there last Monday. He showed me one that he really liked. B: I bet you had to drag him away. A: He wanted to take it home right away ;-). B: I wonder what he'll name it. A: He said he’d name it after his dead hamster – Lemmy  - he's  a great Motorhead fan :-)))

Luigi: Geez, Mayweather totally destroyed McGregor! Did you watch gentlemen?? Lorenzo: I'm not very much into boxing, rather prefer MMA but the buzz about this fight made me watch it Lorenzo: And yeah, the black guy seemed to be only defending himself for a few rounds but at the same time Conor lost much of his stamina Pablo: Whatta hell are you two talking about?? Pablo: McGregor and boxing?? He's an mma warrior, those R 2 different worlds! Wtf Pablo: And Mayweather?? He's fuckin 40, he's to fuckin old to fight! Luigi: Hahaha Pablito :D Luigi: You follow UFC events and you know mcgregor's a freak and likes to provoke people Pablo: Aight but those R people from mma that he provokes, not from fuckin boxing! Pablo: He's fuckin one unpredictable piece of bastard Lorenzo: You better watch your mouth Pablo cause if Conor finds out what you're sayin, you'll be the next xD Pablo: Sheit dudes, that's a fuckin nonsense Pablo: But anyway... Mayweather won, you've said that. And McGregor? Was he sharp? Luigi: He was, actually I was surprised cause he was fighting pretty well for 5 maybe 6 rounds Luigi: Floyd had to keep his guard up and seemed to have little chances cuz the Irishman was attacking again an again Luigi: But you know, Floyd is an old bird and all this time he was waiting for Conor to get tired and you know the rest :) Pablo: Experience bitch, he beat 'The Notorious' thanks to his fuckin experience! Luigi: No doubt about it, bro Lorenzo: But you know, Mcgregor's never fought 10 rounds, in MMA 3 rounds is the limit Pablo: True Lorenzo: So what if they agreed for a rematch on the mma rules?? :) Pablo: Duuuuuude Pablo: Conor would destroy him, no doubt Luigi: Who knows, maybe they've been planning two differnt fights, who knows :) Pablo: Hope so, I'm goin to fuckin wait for the fight even if it would be at 4 am Lorenzo: Good old Pablo... I love your temperament you son of a bitch Pablo: Yeah, you're not the first bitch to say that Luigi: Lol xD

Kyle: Who wants to go out for a drink? Megan: No, sorry, I'm cleaning the house today. Roseanne: You've always loved cleaning, haven't you? I remember how angry you used to get with your brother for leaving a mess in the kitchen. Vince: Yeah, she'd always yell at me, even though I was the one in charge when our parents were away. Kyle: I don't get why it matters so much whether I clean my flat once a week or once a month. No one died from a bit of dust. Megan: Remind me to never stay at your place :P Roseanne: I'm somewhere in between. My house is always a mess, but I hate it when it's dirty. Vince: What's the difference? Roseanne: I can't stand when there's dust, crumbs on the floor etc., so I clean regularly. But I love it when all my stuff just lies around. When I put everything back on shelves or into cabinets, I keep on getting mad that I have to look for it, get up and take it out, and generally lose so much time. I like to have everything within my reach. Vince: There's no better wardrobe than the armchair, right? XD Kyle: I prefer the floor. There's more space on it :D Megan: Just reading this gives me the creeps. Kyle: Fine, go back to cleaning, we'll think of you while sharing a beer :D Roseanne: Hey, I never said I can come. My hubby's away this weekend, so I have no one to leave the kids with ;( Vince: Take them to Megan's place, they can help her clean :D Megan: You know what? I don't care. I can watch your kids, Roseanne. Just bring them over. Roseanne: But are you serious or just mad at us? Megan: No, I'm serious. I like your kids. And they're nice enough that if I ask them to do something, they actually do it :D Roseanne: LOL, okay. Actually, I think that when I tell them to go and help aunt Meg with cleaning, they'll think it's fun. Vince: And when you tell them to clean their own rooms, they say you're a monster? :D Roseanne: Exactly. But Bill for example always cleans the windows at my parents house. They don't even need to ask anymore, he simply knows it's his job. Kyle: Do they pay him? :P Roseanne: Well, sometimes. But still I think he likes doing it. I don't know, maybe it's because no one checks if he did it well, he's just left alone to do his thing, so he feels like a man in the house in a way? Megan: Tell them I can pay with cookies if they help me. Roseanne: The famous chocolate cookies? Megan: Why not? I'm feeling generous today :D Roseanne: Guys, I think I'm gonna change my mind about that beer. Meg, would you accept one more helper? :D Megan: You're always welcome! But sorry boys, it's going to be a “girls only” event (except for little Billy). Otherwise my house will never get cleaned today :D

But there were no choice😰 Stefy: keep hope, and think about next month Stefy: sun, sea, and martini ....

Sandra: Hey, are you busy this Friday? Olivia: hi, no, not really, why? :) Sandra: Don't laugh at me, but one of my new year resolutions is to learn horse riding. Olivia: Wow! Are you serious? Sandra: What do you think? Olivia: Hm, not sure. It sounds really cool, but isn't it dangerous? Sandra: Well, it can be, yes, but I don't think it's much more dangerous than driving a car. Sandra: Accidents happen everywhere. I get your point, I was thinking about it as well. Olivia: And? Aren't you afraid? Sandra: A bit, yes, but I always wanted to learn horse riding, so I thought that as soon as it isn't anything that requires me to, I don't know, go abroad or a lot of money, I may at least give it a try. Olivia: Makes sense. I'm just worried ;) Sandra: I know <3 Pity though as I wanted you to join me :>... Olivia: Me?! Sandra: I booked a slot on Friday afternoon after work. So far I booked only one, but I know there some slots left. Sandra: Sooo... Do you want to join me? :) Olivia: What time exactly? Sandra: We should be there around 5.30, the lesson starts at 6.

Max: So it seems like we're finally getting ourselves a car. George: Whoa, for real? Sweet, I know you've wanted one for a while. What make? Max: Oh, a Toyota. It'll be sooo much more convenient now. Our place isn't really that easy to reach by public transport, there's only one bus and it's like the timetable doesn't exist so you often end up waiting at the stop for ages. George: Oh man, I remember it used to be like this. I thought things might've changed since the times I used to take the bus to visit you, but I guess not? Max: Yeah, sadly... but whatever. Now we won't have to rely on them any more, woohoo! George: Must have been hard to convince Sylvia, no? Max: She was against it at first but I knew she had to give in eventually. I mean, it'll benefit all of us, after all. George: Man, you'll be so happy, I'm sure. I know I don't regret it. Nothing beats the comfort and freedom, really. Max: Yeah, I'm trying to convince her to get a licence, too. I don't want her to feel like I'm only doing this for myself. It would be better if both of us could drive.

Oliver: I think I should stop reading the rules after we already played a game Oliver: found two things we were doing wrong today Chris: maybe it shows that you should keep reading them Chris: so what we were doing wrong? Oliver: first the basic follow-up only gives you temp influence and not the permanent one (so my whole strategy for the day was basically based on a wrong rule :P) Oliver: and second, you only get the income for the resources you own (tokens on top) and not for everything you have access to Chris: the map had full symbol drawn for the action so I also thought it was permanent influence Chris: had no idea about the second one Emily: the second rule means money would be much more sparse Oliver: well yes but it gives you a reason to build an already existing building again Oliver: with the rules we played with there was no sense in doing that Emily: true Emily: yet another game we need to play again with the right rules ;) Oliver: additionally during the vote phase, if there is a draw the first decision is taken by the player with the least amount of points and not the closest to the player initiating the vote Chris: makes sense Chris: but I'm not sure about the income phase, it's written that you get income for import Olivier: well yes but technically the import action is building your own buildings Oliver: so no matter how you look at it with import you'll always be on top with your token and get the income Chris: right Chris: well just like Emily said we need to play this again Emily: we can always do it during the next meeting Oliver: as usual I'm up for anything Oliver: but if we'll play a new game, let me read the rules first :P

Amanda: oh no, my phone charger has stopped working Keith: the cable or the charger itself? Amanda: dunno, it just won't charge Keith: can't you ask your sister to lend you hers? Amanda: but I have an iphone and she has a samsung Keith: hmm, yeah, but the charger itself should be the same. so if you use your cable with her charger, you could see if it works? Keith: then at least you'll know which part needs replacing Amanda: oh, I could do that, yeah Amanda: should I get the spare part from apple or...? Keith: idk, I've never had an iphone. I hear not all cables are compatible for some reason but imo you should be able to find a cheaper replacement that should work... their prices are too high Amanda: uhh... alright, I guess checking what's wrong comes first Keith: can you do it now? Amanda: yeah, I'll brb Keith: k Amanda: back Amanda: and it's still not charging :( Keith: then it must be the cable. or... Amanda: or?? there's another possibility? Keith: well, I guess there might be sth wrong with the charging port but that's the worst case scenario Keith: so let's not think about it yet? Amanda: I'm a bit worried now but ok :( Keith: I've found some shop that sells replacement cables Keith: <file_other> Keith: I'd try this one first, see if the phone detects the cable at all Keith: cuz if it does, then problem solved, if it doesn't... then it might be the port Keith: but it's cheap enough to give it a try Amanda: thanks, I'll do that... I hope it'll work, not sure if I can afford a repair :/

Fran: so how's the new affair going?;) Sally: hmm Fran: what happened? Sally: I'm not sure. I mean everything is fine but there's no chemistry. Maybe there's something wrong with me Fran: There's nothing wrong with you. Don't let yourself think that. Maybe you just need more time Sally: It's not like I wanna give up but sometimes I wonder if I should be forcing myself Fran: Definitely not. But maybe try not to put so much pressure on it Sally: I just don't understand it. And myself Fran: You don't have to understand anything :) Sally: I mean there was definitely a spark at the beginning and now I really don't know what happened and how to get it back Fran: You probably started thinking too much ;) Sally: Hahah probably. My head is my worst enemy Fran: You just met, don't force it. Why would you want chemistry that just dies out after 3 months? Maybe deep down you're looking for something more serious or stable and that's why you actually don't wanna rush it? And you're older now. It's more difficult to fall madly in love when you are not so easily fooled anymore ;) Sally: I get it. It's not even about falling in love. I just don't get what happened. I mean I can't be in a relationship with absolutely no chemistry at all Fran: Well it went away so maybe it will come back :D You can't overthink those things. They don't like it ;) Sally: I probably am overthinking. We had a heart to heart and I feel much better after the talk Fran: You want soulmates, intellectual connection, and chemistry - that's some high expectations for a new relation. Not everything at once Sally: Yeah I would but I know I can't have it all Fran: Of course you can. But some things work better overtime. On the other hand, do NOT force yourself into anything.  Sally: I'm not going to. I guess I've been lucky I found someone who is understanding and wants to discuss things Fran: Exactly. And once you feel safer, chemistry might come back, because you won't be analyzing and thinking and worrying and pressuring yourself ;) Sally: You're probably right.

Just give me your dates and I'll keep it booked for you. Beryl: Would you prefer me to do it via airbnb website or just like this directly with you?

Anton: ASAP really. As I say we've been receiving bookings daily now. Beryl: Well, no big deal. I'll be staying in Cape Town for a longer time and am quite flexible in my dates.

I'll call you beforehand from Cape Town. Greetings to you both! Anton: Take care!

Kate: Don't you get it? Claire: Not really Kate: I'll meet someone and will have a kid! Frank: aren't you misinterpreting things? Claire: Did she tell you that it was what it meant?

Patricia: Barry!! Have you heard the news? They released a demo gameplay from Cyberpunk 2077! Barry: What, really? Where did you see that? Patricia: <file_video> Barry: Holy shit, that's pretty impressive... I was pumped for the game already but now THIS is hype. Whoa. Patricia: I know, right! I loved Wild Hunt but this is like a completely different level? Barry: It really is. I guess we'll see when the game gets released but for once the NPCs seemed like real people, even the crowds. They said they'd be working on that and now I'm sold. Patricia: Yeah, they didn't move awkwardly or anything, it really felt like the world was alive. I can't wait!! Barry: It's only a shame about the POV... Patricia: You don't like first-person? Barry: Well, I guess it's okay at times but I'd prefer over-the-shoulder. They say you can customise everything about your character so I'd kind of like to be able to see my gear because otherwise what's the point. Patricia: Huh... I actually haven't played first-person much, but I ended up really enjoying it in Morrowind. It felt really immersive and when I switched to third-person view for a moment, it felt strange. Barry: Well, I'll still be hoping for an option to switch to third-person... Patricia: I wouldn't really count on that. They seem really committed to their vision and think this is the best choice so people can enjoy the world 100%. Barry: I'm still not sure but y'know, not gonna hate until it's actually release. It looks really good so far so I'd be happy if they proved me wrong and made me enjoy the POV. Patricia: I just wish they'd tell us the release date already! Barry: Hmm, who knows... I think it was supposed to be ready this year, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

Evelina: You should have told me. I could have helped you with something. Paul: It was not that bad. I have been able to do everything, is just that I was feeling pretty weird. And I could not really at anything. Evelina: And what did the doctor say? Paul: He said that is probably some indigestion as I don't have any other symptoms. No fever, vomitting or anything. Evelina: Ok, that's good. Did he give you any medicine or something? Paul: He gave me some herbs mix and if that does not help me told me to come back and they will do an ultrasound. Evelina: Ok. Have you already got the medicine?  Paul: No, not yet. I have been to a couple of pharmacies but they did not have it. Evelina: Have you tired the one by the Mobil gas station? They are always pretty well equipped. Paul: No. I haven't been there. Will stop by there in the afternoon. Evelina: Let me know later if you bought it. If not I will look around too. Paul: Thanks. I will let you know. And I really appreciate your care. Evelina: No problem. Paul: Will keep you posted. Evelina: Ok. Sounds good.

Lewis: Don't tell me you've taken up gardening :D Barney: No, I dropped my mum's favorite orchid and now I have to replant it before she comes back. Lewis: LOL, you're so clumsy! Judith: Wait, I'll ask my Mum. Lewis: You can always say it was the cat's fault :P Barney: Then she'll say it was my fault anyway because I let the cat do it. Lewis: Do you think she won't notice that you replanted it? Barney: I hope so :D No, but in all seriousness, I hope that if she sees I did all I could to save it, she won't be that mad.

Barney: Thank you! I've already ordered an identical pot from Amazon, but I forgot to order that bark too, and now it's too late to buy it online. Why can't orchids grow in soil like normal plants?

Matty: Aah ok. So the long report is a big part of your degree and counts a lot towards it? Matty: And it's very wide the topic. Can talk about that yes, can also do social and cultural stuff too in there Ella: Yeah, basically my grades and my report make up my degree :) Social and cultural stuff... like what? Matty: Aaah cool :D I have exams too which make mine up haha. Lucky you Matty: And stuff like social separation and classes and how everything plays into each other and culture is like heritage and what matters to different people Ella: I meant grades from exams, so I don't know if I'm really that lucky :P That's actually really interesting! So how do you prepare for this? Do you get to interview people? Matty: Oh right haha. And I have to do loads of reading and prepare some fieldwork. And I likely will have to inerview people yeah. What kind of things do you do in the lab? Ella: Depends on your field of study - I'm doing Embriology, so I basically conduct experiments on mouse oocytes that should hopefully give some decent results. But other people can grow bacteria on petri dishes if they're doing Microbiology, or study particular fragments of DNA if they're doing Genetics Ella: It really depends on what you're studying - Biology has a pretty large spectrum, afterall :)

Michaela: So what do you guys think about the association idea? Ron: I might be lacking the context here Michaela: Basically we were thinking of turning the club into an official association, so it's easier to get funds for events for example Jessie: I'm torn actually - I get why it would help with funds, cooperation with other institutions and such, but I researched it and it involves quite a bit of paperwork. Steve: And someone to take care of it permanently, cause it doesn't end at setting up the association - you have to do it every year. Michaela: These are exactly the kind of things that I wanted to discuss with you. Do we have anyone willing to take care of the paperwork? Doesn't have to be one person. Steve: Frankly, I don't see anyone doing this - we all have jobs, barely have time for meetings sometimes and it's a ton of responsibility Ron: The question is - do the profits of being an association surpass the costs - like the amount of time and work we put into it? There are also some financial costs, are there? Michaela: yeah, like a small fee when you set it up, but nothing more really. Jessie: so what do we get from it really? Michaela: maybe the cost of a rubber stamp. Michaela: for example here are subsidies the city gives out every year, but to apply you need to be a formal association <file_other> Ron: and there was this time when that community center refused to work with us, because we weren't an association Jessie: I think there were two times we were rejected cause of that actually Michaela: I recall two as well Steve: but do we truly need those subsidies? We've worked for almost 4 years without them and for me that was the beauty of it - that you can organize events without spending tons of money on it, just with collective effort. Steve: I'm just afraid we're gonna lose this sense of an informal get-together, it's all just gonna turn into a business and will create tensions between us. I've seen it happen to clubs like ours Ron: it's not necessarily going to happen to us and we could make some better events with more funding Michaela: association is not a business, we're not gonna start selling things. It's just about access to the possibilities that's we're denied right now cause we're not a formal association Jessie: well... I could help out with the paperwork, but not alone. I'd say 2 more people would be enough to make this work Michaela: as this was my idea, I can help too, just a matter of dividing our work properly Ron: I can't take up additional responsibilities right now with all that's been going on, so I won't be able to help, buy if y'all agree it's a good idea, I'm going to support it Michaela: Steve? Steve: I don't know man, I like things the way they are right now Michaela: Ok, maybe it's better to talk about this in person. Is Monday after the meeting ok for you all? Steve: yup, I can stay a bit longer Jessie: Fine by me Ron: as well

Debra: Sorry, I'm not the best person to talk to these days Bruce: What are you talking about?? It's fine, I know you've been going through a rough patch Bruce: I wrote coz I really wanted to know how you've been, you don't have to force yourself to act happy Debra: Thanks, Bruce Debra: I'm not sure I can express how much I appreciate the fact that you're here for me Bruce: Don't mention it Debra: No, it's a big thing to me... Actually, not too many people have talked to me recently, so I was a little lonely Debra: I think I might cry, I'm sorry Bruce: Oh no, please don't cry :( I'm here Debra: I know... it's not entirely bad tears, it's also because I'm happy I have you Debra: I'm just kind of emotional Bruce: /hug Debra: Thank you, really Bruce: You know you can call me any time, don't you Debra: Yeah...

Alice: Sure, class is always the most difficult and controversial  Bob: But maybe this is the point - to provoke people? Alice: Exactly! Do not be afraid, the worst is to be mediocre. Bob: Do you think I should talk more generally or give some examples? Alice: I think you should give as short an introduction as possible Bob: And what then? Alice: Then get to your examples, things from your research! Bob: I am not sure. Alice: Of course, they are the best, the most original and new. That's what you're about! Bob: Maybe you're right Alice: And fuck the theory! Nobody cares Bob: Hahaha, ok, will you read my outline? Alice: Sure, I'll be honoured  Bob: Thanks!

Jody: I hate ironing! Lynn: Me too! Jody: Especially shirts! Lynn: I know, that's a pain in the neck! Jody: My hubby uses like 5 shirts a week! And all I do is iron them! Lynn: Can't he do it himself? Jody: Wouldn't even let him near an iron! Lynn: Why not? Jody: Well, mostly because the last time he did ironing, he burnt my favourite shirt and two of his own. Lynn: How did he manage to do that? Jody: Have no idea. Suppose he left the iron on the shirts and forgot to unplug it, but will never know.  Lynn: Have you tried an ironing machine? Jody: Yes, I have an iron at home. Don't need to borrow it from the neighbour. Lynn: No, like this: <file_other> Jody: What's this? Lynn: An ironing machine. Useful with shirts, T-shirts and similar.  Jody: So, how does it work? Lynn: Not sure. Probably hot air goes through and pushes the material out so that it also irons it.  Jody: Sounds too good to be true. Lynn: But it isn't! I have a similar one and it actually works! Jody: Rly? Can I come over someday and judge for myself? Lynn: Sure! I'm doing the laundry tonight.

Jan: Guys... the landlord has just published her review of us. It's I-N-S-A-N-E <file_photo> Emma: Give me a sec Ricardo: FUCK Emma: I especially like the bit about Janek being "sombre" and "exceptionally rude" Jan: omg was I? Emma: Hmmmm well, I bet it's one of these cultural differences... As a Spaniard she probably expected you to become her best friend and have a friendly chat about the weather... Instead, you greeted her enumerating all the faults of the apartment (which I would also do, but I understand if it was too much for her). Jan: Well then, I'll write to her and apologise, perhaps she'll change the review? Emma: I doubt it, but you can try if you have a moment to spare. Again, I don't really think you've done anything wrong, but upon some consideration, she might have misunderstood our non-Spanish behaviour Jan: Yeah, I think you're right. Also, I assume this thing about cigarette fags all over the balcony is yet another delusion of hers? Emma: Fuuuck. I actually might have left some... I was so tired in the morning I didn't even think about that. I'm so sorry guys 😭 Jan: Well, it looks like we deserve the shitty review and there's not much we can do about it, can we? Ricardo: Hmmm, yeah, you might be right. In any case it's only one negative review by a silly old woman, I don't really think it'll ruin our lives Jan: I feel like it'll totally ruin mine 💩 Emma: Change your name to Juan as I've been suggesting for years Jan: 😂 Ricardo: When life gives you lemons, change your name to Juan Emma: And your life will be much fun lalalalaaaa 🎵 Jan: AAAAAAAAAAAA 🙉🙉🙉

We both know they wouldn't talk to a girl they don't find pretty so don't beat yourself about it Olivia: Thanks dear Olivia: What should I do? He asked me out again Carrie: I’d give him another chance. Sometimes there are no sparkles in the beginning Carrie: But you said you like talking to him Olivia: Yeah, he’s nice, I’m not sure if not too nice ;) Carrie: Hahaha, we sure are from the same family Olivia: I said I’d go out with him again Olivia: Ok, he suggested we can go to the cinema again… Carrie: Very creative indeed :D Olivia: Maybe I’m weird, but come on, I don’t feel like going any more. Carrie: Eh… Go out with him once more and if you’re bored again just tell him no.

My language got really bad last year! Wanda: Yeah, I remember! I was shocked, but everyone does it here! Helena: Here too, only with Scottish accent as well, it did take me a few months to get used to it! Wanda: You're a lot braver than me, I only went about 15 miles to Leeds. Helena: Yep, you didn't move out of West Yorks even! Wanda: Well, I prefer it! I can even go and work in the petrol station till 10pm and pop home on the late train if I want to, saves me food money to have a day or two of home cooking, plus it's a lot nicer. Helena: I know what you mean! I can't be arsed to peel veg and stuff like that, I exist on take aways and convenience micro meals, not good! Wanda: Have you got I to the famous Scottish deep fried Mars bar craze? Helena: 🤣I have had one, but Edinburgh is a bit posher than Glasgow where it's more popular. Do like square sausage and cloutie dumpling, though! Wanda: You'll have to initiate me into these delicacies when I come visit. Helena: You bet! When can you make it?  Wanda: Well, I have two days off lectures at the end of next week and I can swap my shifts around if I do it tomorrow. I reckon I can train it up next Thurs if that suits you. Helena: Should be fine! I have got lectures Friday mind, you could try a bit of sightseeing, perhaps? Wanda: I would love to see the Castle and the National Art Gallery, have a wee look round too, hen! Helena: Don't start trying to act all Scottish, you sassenach! Wanda: Not sure what that means, but you're a Yorkshire lass too and you do it! Helena: Yes, but I'm an adopted Scottish person now. I'd really like to stay on here, maybe do a PGCE. Wanda: You a teacher! You haven't got the bloody patience to deal with kids all day! Helena: Maybe, but it's an idea I've been toying with, convey my passion for history to the young! Wanda: Hopefully, the young will share your enthusiasm! Helena: Well, we'll see, still got over a year to decide! Wanda: Think about it carefully, my sister teaches Geography over in Brighouse, as you know. She's only been doing it 3 years and she feels burnt out at the end of term! Helena: Oh yeah, forgot about that! Anyway, keep me posted about next weekend, can't wait to see you if you can manage it! Wanda: Me too, bye Chuck! Helena: Bye 😗!

Tiffany: Who's Elon Musk? Blair: You know nothin', John Snow. Dale: Srsly? Never heard of him? Tiffany: Nope, sorry. Dale: He set up PayPal, Tesla and SpaceX. Blair: He wants to go to the moon. He's creating the first passenger shuttle to the moon. Tiffany: Rly? :) How much is the ticket? Dale: Depends. Currently around $ 35 mil.  Tiffany: What? Blair: Rly. Unfortunately, that kinda cash doesn't fit into my piggy bank.  Dale: Bt the good news is that you'll be able to watch it using VR! Tiffany: How?! Blair: Apparently they're going to stream the whole thing in HD via their satellites.  Tiffany: Wow! Amazing! When? Dale: No one really knows. When they finally build the shuttle and set off, but the date is not known for now. Tiffany: Shame. Maybe until then I'll manage to buy myself this VR headset ;)  Blair: You really should! If not for work, you can always use it for pleasure :) Dale: Just don't play horror games. You'll get a heart attack. Tiffany: Really that scary? Dale: Tried it once. Nevermind the money. I'm not doing it again.  Blair: Someone got scared? ;) Dale: But all other games are fine. And the experiences are unspeakable! Blair: I do confirm that. When you put on the headset it's a little awkward at first, but when you forget about it, virtual reality becomes reality. Tiffany: Where can I buy this? Dale: The easiest way? Online.  Blair: Remeber, it's not cheap.  Dale: <file_other> <file_other> <file_other> <file_other> <file_other> There you go. Tiffany: Cheap is not the word that best describes it.

Leu: How are you? Any new development about the house? Luisa: Hello my dear!  Sadly not. No news at all regarding the house :(( We'll be sitting on it till the end of our lives! Leu: That can't be. It is such a fantastic property. In such an incredibly beautiful estate. It's a matter of time. Luisa: That's what we thought last spring when we put it on the market. Leu: It took me 2 years to sell my flat back in Poland. Luisa: Oh well... Wait and see. The last prospective buyers we had, 5 weeks back, were so enthusiastic we'd thought we're done. They said ours was shortlisted, their favourite in Ballito, but they still wanted to check another estate. And that was it. She didn't even bother to phone, just sent me a minimal message. Bill got so frustrated that he drank himself stiff that night. Leu: He does it from time to time, doesn't he? Luisa: From time to time? Regularly!!! Can't you remember?! Leu: Not quite. Never saw him really tight. Luisa: Cause you used to leave before his evening was over. I'm seriously worried about his health, to tell you the truth. It's just every day that he tipples. Leu: As if slowly killing himself with liquor. Luisa: He doesn't care. He says he's got his life behind him. Leu: But it is terrible. How can you cope with it? Luisa: I stopped to care too. It is his life. If he wants to put a quicker end to it, it's up to him. Look I cannot do anything about it. What hide bottles? Just don't want to have an invalid in my house one day. Leu: Therapy? Luisa: Gimme a break! Can you imagine Bill attending an AA therapy like a good boy! I can't. Leu: Nor can I. Luisa: We even stopped talking about his drinking problem long ago. When he started, just after and because of his early retirement, I thought I'd better refrain from commenting because he's so depressed. But then it was worse and worse... Now it's too late. Leu: Poor Luisa, poor Bill. It is so sad. But you are tough Luisa. You are so incredibly tough and strong and even-tempered, I'd say. Luisa: Yes, I am. That keeps me sane. I don't worry if I can't change it. To a degree... Leu: Right you are! "The beach scape changes every month as tides bring in tons of sand and cover the rocks making the beach appear totally different." Do you remember? Luisa: "Then the rocks are laid bare as the tide pulls away the sand. Such is life."

Jeanne: Usually I like everything that involves chocolate, but I'm not sure if I'd try something like that. Vanessa: Yeah, it's simply too much... Jaimie: IMO it's not even pizza anymore. It's more like a pie. Clive: Hey, Jaimie, I remember you ordering Hawaiian pizza :P Jaimie: Yup, I'm fine with pineapple, maybe even some cranberry, but only if there's also enough cheese and meat to counterbalance it. Who the hell makes sweet pizza? Vanessa: The world is full of weird people after all... ;)

Steven: Hello, kids. It's time to start the annual mission “GIFT FOR MUM”! Margaret: Dad, can't we just meet in the garage like a normal family? Steven: Nope, Mum can hear us there, she won't hear us on Facebook! Harry: Unless she just steals your phone... Lesley: Hey, let's just get it over with, okay? Steven: See, that's the spirit!  Harry: Dad, Lesley simply has basketball in two hours and wants you to give her a lift :P Lesley: You little snitch! Steven: Calm down, kids, no one leaves this house until we decide what to get Mum on her birthday. Lesley: But Dad! Steven: Don't “Dad” me. Think! Margaret: No worries, your awesome big sister is here :D Mum was interested in this food processor: <file_other> Harry: You want to buy Mum a kitchen appliance? Steven: What's wrong with that? Last Christmas I got her an iron. Lesley: Yeah, a great way to suggest her we see her as our servant :P Margaret: Hey, that was mean!  Harry: Any other ideas? Lesley: What about a spa break? Steven: I like the idea. But isn't it too expensive? Margaret: No, actually prices are quite varied, depending on what exactly is included in the offer. Give me a sec. Harry: Are we giving her mud baths? XD Margaret: Moron.  Steven: Maggie, don't be mean to your brother. Margaret: OK, OK. Look at this offer <file_other>. Or this one <file_other>. Lesley: I like the second one better. Steven: I have no idea what all these things even mean, so I'll have to trust you on this one, girls. Harry: What, no mud baths?!  Steven: Harold, one more word and you'll be washing my car tonight. And there's a lot of mud on it. Margaret: Okay, the second one then. If no one objects, I'll take care of it. Just give me the money :D
Max: Din anyone actually watch this the video?  Max: <link_video> Allen: Research shows that long term cannabis use ( via smoke inhalation ) produces NO noticeable long term consequences - whereas tobacco use leads to COPD ect. But cannabis causes more inflammation of the lungs and increase symptoms such as wheeziness and shortness of breath. But these subside when cannabis smoking ceases. Jeremy: Wrong, it wasn't long term use, but rather an "occasional low cumulative", which could be something like smoking once or twice a month. Max: Tom You didn’t watch the video. Tom: I was just about to complain, then i saw your post. Thanks. ;) Jason: I like how he doesn't mention the fact that most people smoking spliffs will probably be using tobacco in them as well pretty much everybody I know who smokes weed put tobacco in them and they smoke cigarettes as well. Daniel: Short attention span 😊 Max: Daniel probably from pot 🤷‍♂️ Max: Jason he does - rewatch the end man. He doesn’t specifically say combing the two , but he says one usually precedes the other.  David: Jason, I used to smoke baccy avec hashish but no longer, and I know only one person out of billions who still smokes weed with tobacco. Rawiri: Jason Hollis yuck...why even??? Tom: I know that a joint is bigger than a roach, so is a spliff bigger than a joint? David: I don’t believe there is a size relationship between names of roll-ups (except for the roach which is a mostly smoked roll-up). I say that the names began as code words for an illegal item at that time. Some spliffs may be big some joints be small... Ken: Allen So quit smoking it and no inflammation which we all know that inflammation is the number one cause of all other health issues. Tom: BTW Seeing it's still illegal at a federal level, I'd like to know where such studies were conducted legally. Propaganda. Keep gobbling those opiate based pills, they're fine Brian: this is only stating the harms of smoking cannabis. It's not saying cannabis is harmful... there are other ways to use it without turning to opiates. Ken: Really? Putting smoke in your lungs is bad for your respiratory system.....shocker. oil....edibles...many ways to enjoy and get relief from chronic pain and or what ever you need to get on with it. Mark: Cannabis does not have a bad affect on the lungs!! Virginia: MJ users will not believe anything bad. They think it is right up there with kale and swiss chard!

Tom: Nah, that's like the highest one you can get and it's awarded by the president. He got something else. Rod: Purple Heart? Tom: yeah, he got that, but that's cause he died in combat.

George: You coming out for a few rounds this Friday night? John: I wish I could mate but the missus insists we must spend 'quality time' together. Family responsibilities and all that. George: I understand but it would be good if she let you out now and again to have a few beers with your mates. John: Yeah it would. George: How is the family life going? John: Could be better. George: Meaning...? John: Missus wants me to spend more time with the kids and to spend time with her. It's either one or the other since I can't see how I can do both. John: So we end up fighting the whole time. John: Thought that this is family time thing is supposed to be fun instead it is stressful and annoying. John: Sometimes I think that I'm not cut out for the family life. George: Sounds like you're not really enjoying it. I can fully relate. This is why I stay single and made sure to get the snip. John: Don't get me wrong I DO love my kids but all the extra pressure from the wife doesn't help. She doesn't know what she bloody wants.  John: Whatever I do is not good enough. Can't win. Ugh! George: Women! I could never work them out!  John: I thought I could but now I'm not so sure. George: Maybe a break on Friday night might be a good idea. Help you to clear your head. John: Yeah, I think you're right... I'll think about it. George: Right-O! Let me know when you decide. Hopefully catch up with you on Friday night.

But she actually was very polite and never said anything.  Alan: That's a good sign actually :)  John: Well, the flat is a typical rental, so she must have seen some stuff :)  Alan: Yeah, I can imagine :) Alan: Anyway, how's the apartment? John: Well, decent would be the best word to describe it.  John: the rooms are old, haven't been renovated in quite some time John: The kitchen is OK - no luxurious stuff but quite nice looking. And there is a dishwasher :) Alan: Always a plus - I can't imagine living without one now :) John: The bathroom has been renovated recently - so it's new and in this kind of rental-basic style John: In general, if I were buying it for myself it would need a serious overhaul, but as a rental should be ok Alan: So what's stopping you? You don't seem all that enthusiastic John: The rent is rather high so I would expect a bit more for that money Alan: Well, then try to negotiate, if she's been renting it already for some time then she knows the game :) You always set the price higher in case you find someone who would be willing to pay it :) John: Yeah, that's a good idea Alan: And let me know how it went. Would be good to have all the gang closer :) John: yeah, that would be cool :) Will let you know!

Jill: Did she strain her heart during the walk? Doris: We don't know, but there is also sign of an injury a long while ago. It worries me that there was no warning. Jill: It is worrying that we can't see what's getting weaker within us. No warnings as you say. How does she take it emotionally? Doris: She is quite strong. Jill: Good! You too I hope? Doris: Yes, absolutely. Jill: Keep it up! Where is she? Doris: Pietermaritzburg Jill: How long do you have to drive there? Doris: 1.5 hours off peak traffic. Jill: Not so bad. Will you be driving to see her soon? Doris: Dunno yet. Her condition is stable. She's got her husband and 3 children around her. But I may go and stay with her when she's back home. Jill: To help with the household? Doris: Exactly. But it may be that they'll first send her for recuperation somewhere. Jill: They usually do after a serious operation, don't they? Doris: That would be very good for her indeed. Also mentally. She's strong but her body may need a rest. We'll see! Jill: I'll keep fingers crossed for you! Both of you. Doris: Thx Jill. You never know what helps :)) Jill: Take care my friend! Doris: You too.

Ashley: This one is mostly for the ladies (but certainly open to the men of the tribe, too!!).....Some of us had talked about an eyebrow skillshare and since I plan to reshape and dye/tint my eyebrows in the next few days, it seems like the perfect time to get moving on this. We can discuss eyebrow/face geometry, brow mapping, how to tint/dye them (should you wish to, I have brown and black dye with me and I welcome you to use it), and how to fill them in with makeup.  Let me know if you would like to join! Gerardo: Yall can clean my eyebrows if u need a pair to practice on Ashley: If you are curious how my passion for eyebrows began, it was because I was formerly the program manager overseeing the implementation of a program designed to help individuals going through cancer regain self-confidence through beauty techniques - with a heavy emphasis on drawing on new eyebrows. <file_link> Anna: <file_gif> Ashley: Gery, fully expect you to attend this skillshare now that you have offered yourself up.

Gita: Yes, it really helps to do some sort of work doesn't it! I could never manage full time, though. Bev: Oh, I know, Gita. My sister's in management and she doesn't see her kids from 6.30am to 6.30pm every day! She is a high flier, but she does miss them. She does do lots with them on the weekend, though.

Is Beti looking forward to feeding the lambs and seeing the baby animals on the farm, Milo is very excited. Gita: Oh yes! She loves animals, we have a few pets at home. Bev: Well, we only have fish, they are pretty but not very interesting! Gita: Suppose you're right! What time do we have to be at school on Wednesday? Bev: Quite early, I think about 7.45, the bus leaves at 8 and we get to Holly Farm about 10, I think. Gita: Hope the rain keeps off, especially if it's outdoors. I'll check their website. Bev: Yes, good idea. Anyway, see you Weds, Gita! Gita: Bye, Bev!
